It is possible to change the credentials that GKS is using to create Openstack resources.
This could be needed after changing the password, or when we need to use a different account.

## Change the credentials

Changing the credentials is as easy as following these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired cluster.

3. Select `Edit Provider`

4. Change credentials

Soon after performing these steps, a confirmation message pops up, and the credentials have been changed successfully.
