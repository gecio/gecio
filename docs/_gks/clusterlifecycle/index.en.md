# Cluster Lifecycle

The management of an GKS-Kubernetes-Cluster is handled by the platform itself, but some tasks still require customer interaction. This is not only true for the cluster creation and deletion tasks, but also true for cluster updates which could require a (rolling) restart of worker nodes, such as Kubernetes updates.
