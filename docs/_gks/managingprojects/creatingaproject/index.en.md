After logging into GKS, you see the following window, where you
need to click on `Add Project`.

To finish, click on `Save`.

Now GKS creates your project and adds it to the Overview. With a click on
the entry `Team Kubernetes` you enter the project and can create
the cluster.

clusters and their users, as well as some other controls.
