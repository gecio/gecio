Step 5: An overview of the most important commands of the OpenStackClient
=========================================================================

Start
-----

Now that we've installed the OpenStack client in step 4, we will learn
some of the more important commands for it.

To get more details about a specific subcommand, you can append the
`--help` flag to it.

To list all commands, you can use `--help` without any other
information:

```
openstack --help
```

Server
------

With the command `openstack server` it's possible to create,
administrate or delete a VM.

Here is a list of some common commands:

-   `openstack server add`
    This commands will add parameters
    (Fixed IP, Floating IP, Security group, Volume) to a VM.
-   `openstack server create`
    This command creates a VM.
-   `openstack server delete`
    This command deletes a VM.
-   `openstack sever list`
    This command shows a list of all VMs.
-   `openstack server remove`
    This command will remove parameters (Fixed IP, Floating IP, Security
    group, Volume) from a VM.
-   `openstack server show`
    This command shows all important information about the specified VM.

Stack
-----

With the command `openstack stack` you are able to administrate
complete stacks, like `openstack server` for instances.

Here is a list for some common commands:

-   `openstack stack create`
    This command creates a new stack.
-   `openstack stack list`
    This command lists all stacks.

-   `openstack subnet create`
    Creates a new subnet
-   `openstack subnet delete`
    Deletes a subnet
-   `openstack subnet show`
    Shows all infomation about a subnet

Port

-   `openstack volume delete`
    Deletes a volume
