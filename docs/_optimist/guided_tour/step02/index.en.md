Step 2: Create an SSH-Key via the Horizon(Dashboard)
====================================================

Start
-----

To continue our guide, we will need a SSH keypair, if you already have keypair and you know
how to use it, you can skip this step and go directly to step 3.

Installation
------------

There are many ways to generate our SSH keypair, we will create a
keypair manually later but we will create it from the dashboard in this
step.\
To create the SSH keypair, we need to go to *Compute -\> Key Pairs* and
click *Create Key Pair*.

use **BeispielKey** and clickÂ *Create Keypair.*
