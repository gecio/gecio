# Step 2: Create an SSH-Key with the Horizon (Dashboard)

## Start

To continue, you need an SSH keypair. If you already have a keypair and know
how to use it, you can skip this section and continue with [Step 3](/optimist/guided_tour/step03/).

## Installation

There are several ways to generate an SSH keypair. Later in this guided tour, we will show you how to create a
keypair manually. In this step, however, you will learn how to create it from the dashboard.\
To create the SSH keypair, go to *Compute -\> Key Pairs* and
click *Create Key Pair*.
