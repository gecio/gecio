# Changelog Optimist

All notable changes to the Optimist Platform will be documented on this page.

## Deprecation
- With the Train release of OpenStack, which we expect to complete by **Q1, 2022** support for Neutron LBaaS will be deprecated. 
- We encourage customers using our Neutron LBaaS to migrate to Octavia Loadbalancers at their earliest available opportunity.
- Please refer to our [guide](/optimist/migration_guide_loadbalancer/) for more information on migrating your existing Neutron LBaaS to Octavia Loadbalancers.
