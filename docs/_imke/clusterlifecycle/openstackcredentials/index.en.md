It is possible to change the Credential, that iMKE is using to create Openstack Resources.
This could be needed after changing the Password, or we need to use a different account.

## Change the Credentials

Changing the Credentials is as easy as following these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired cluster.

2. Click the three dots, to open the cluster sub menu

3. Select `Edit Cluster`

4. Change Credentials

Soon after performing these steps, a confirmation message pops up, and the Credentials changes successfully.
