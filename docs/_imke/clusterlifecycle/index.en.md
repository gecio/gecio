The management of an iMKE-Kubernetes-Cluster is handled by the platform itself, but some tasks still require customer interaction. This is not only true for the obvious cluster creation and deletion tasks, but also true for cluster updates which could require a (rolling) restart of Worker-Nodes, such as Kubernetes updates.
