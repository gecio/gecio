After logging into iMKE, you will see the following window, where we
need to click on `Add Project`:
![Add Project](addproject.png)

This opens a window, where we can give the project a name. In the
example, we use `Team Kubernetes`.
To finish, we click on `Save`.

Now iMKE creates our Project and adds it to the Overview. With a click on
the entry `Team Kubernetes` we enter the project and now we can create
the cluster.
![Project list](projectlist.png)

This opens a view showing us the project. We find a list of all existing
clusters and their users, as well as some other controls.

Clicking on the sidebar opens the navigation in the Project view, which
allows us to explore the other areas.
