## New URL

The iMKE-dasboard will be renamed to GKS-dashboard, as the new name reflects
the affiliation to German Edge Cloud better than the before.
With this the domain changes as well. The service will now be reachable via
the new URL â€¦[https://gks.gec.io](https://gks.gec.io), beginning 1st July 2022.

## Supported Kubernetes versions

With the current release, we support the following Kubernetes versions:

* 1.21.8
* 1.22.5
* 1.23.6

## End of Life announcements

We will end the support of Kubernetes version 1.21 on the 28th June 2022.

Please make sure to upgrade all existing clusters running 1.21 at least to 1.22 before that date.

## New features

This is a technical release without any new features.

## Bugfixes

* For user clusters that use etcd 3.5 (Kubernetes 1.22 clusters), etcd corruption checks are turned on to detect etcd data consistency issues. Checks run at etcd startup and every 4 hours ([#13766](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ))
